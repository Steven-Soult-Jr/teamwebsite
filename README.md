# SFSU Marketplace
SFSU Marketplace was a class project for CSC 648 - Software Development at San Francisco State University. The point of the project was to practice Agile Software Development to create a buy/sell website (similar to craiglist or ebay) for students at SFSU. Each team had 6-7 members, a team lead, and a Chief Techincal Officer. To see the design process, the files in the milestone folder contain snapshots of the development process throughout the timeline of the project.
